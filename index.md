# Pragmatic Systems Architecture

I'm a Senior Software Engineer transitioning to Principal, with 40 years of programming experience and 15 years building production systems. I write about pragmatic architecture, polyglot programming, and solving real problems with appropriate solutions.

## What I Write About

- **Pragmatic Design**: Starting simple, adding complexity only when needed
- **Polyglot Solutions**: Using the right tool for the problem (Rust, Elixir, Go, Java)
- **AI Architecture**: Event-driven systems and AI-human collaboration
- **Cloud-Native Patterns**: GCP-certified with production experience across AWS, Azure, GCP

## Current Projects

**[Partnership Pinochle Scorer](https://github.com/chwarner-solo/pinochle-scorer)** - Rust backend with clean architecture, demonstrating ports and adapters pattern and domain-driven design.

**Grimoire AI Platform** - Event-driven AI agent platform using Elixir/Phoenix, Neo4j, and Firestore. Architecture design phase.
