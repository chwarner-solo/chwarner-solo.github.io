## Technical Design Documents

I document major architectural decisions using RFCs (Requests for Comments)
before implementation. This demonstrates Staff/Principal-level system design
thinking and ensures complex features are well-planned.

**Sample RFCs:**
- [Authentication & Subscription Architecture](rfcs/001-authentication.md)
- [Feature Flag System](rfcs/002-feature-flags.md) _(coming soon)_
- [RFC Template](rfcs/template.md) - My design process

These are sanitized versions of production RFCs, with product-specific
details removed to protect competitive advantage.
