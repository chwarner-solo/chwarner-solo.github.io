## Chris Warner
**Senior Engineer â†’ Principal | GCP Certified**

I've been programming for 40 years (since age 7) and professionally building systems for 28 years. I specialize in pragmatic architecture - solving real problems with appropriate solutions.

### What I Care About

- **Pragmatic Design**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **First Principles Thinking**: Understanding the "why" behind patterns
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Building systems where both excel at what they do best

### Current Focus

- Rust for systems programming
- Elixir/Phoenix for real-time platforms
- Event-driven AI agent architectures
- GCP cloud-native solutions

### Projects

- [Partnership Pinochle Scorer](https://github.com/chwarner-solo/pinochle-scorer) - Rust backend with clean architecture
- Grimorie AI Platform - Event-driven AI agents with personalized content generation (design phase)
